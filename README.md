# CSS quiz â€” the list of questions to level up your CSS skill
## What it is
CSS is a language with a bunch of topics. There is a developer who knows all unlikely. Honestly, we don't need to know it to do our job. But there is a piece of CSS without that we can't do. It is the goal of my questions.
