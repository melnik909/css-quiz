# You Should Know CSS â€” the list of questions to level up your CSS skill
CSS is a language with a bunch of topics. There is a developer who knows all unlikely. Honestly, we don't need to know it to do our job. But there is a piece of CSS without that we can't do. It is the goal of my questions.

These questions aren't suitable for beginners. You should have at least one year of experience. Two years is better. This time is enough to understand why I wrote these questions. 

## What the difference from others
There is a heap of articles with front-end interview questions that include CSS topics. The problem is that 99% of them check terminology or superficial knowledge. My questions do a deep dive to check your knowledge about nuances.
